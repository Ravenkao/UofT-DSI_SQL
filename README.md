SQL is used across the machine learning pipeline, and is a fundamental skill for data scientists to master. 
This module will focus on the technical skills needed for working with SQL, including flat-file datasets (JSON, CSV) ingestion, query design, and relational database management. 
Additionally, participants will examine common data management concerns, data access management, and data privacy adherence.

Week 1:

Describe the structure of a database.
Use an export command to save and transport data in CSV and JSON file formats.
Use SQL querying and data manipulation techniques to formulate queries for a range of purposes.

Week 2:

Examine the legal framework around sharing data.
Analyze data requirements and work with diverse stakeholders such as analysts and managers.
Use advanced techniques such as String Manipulation, and NULL Management to manipulate results.
